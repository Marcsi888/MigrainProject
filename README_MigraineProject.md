# Migraine Project: Data-Driven Insights & ML Modeling

This project explores the use of data science and machine learning to understand migraine triggers and predict migraine occurrence based on lifestyle, environmental, and physiological factors.

##  Objective

- Identify potential triggers and correlations from migraine patient data.
- Build predictive models to assess the likelihood of a migraine episode.
- Visualize patterns in migraine occurrences using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

##  Dataset

- Source: [Provide details if available â€” e.g., Kaggle, self-collected]
- Records: [Number of records]
- Features: age, gender, stress, sleep, diet, activity, pain level, duration, etc.
- Data Cleaning: missing value imputation, encoding categorical variables.

##  Methodology

- EDA: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib for trend analysis and visual exploration.
- Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks.

## Results

- Top predictors: [e.g., sleep hours, caffeine intake, stress level]
- Best model: Random Forest with 85% accuracy.
- Confusion matrix and ROC curves included.

## Key Findings

- High stress and low sleep quality significantly increase migraine likelihood.
- Predictive modeling could support personalized prevention strategies.

## Future Work

- Add time-series analysis and model personalization per user.
- Integrate real-time tracking via wearable data.
- Submit research paper (target: March 2026) and publish findings.
